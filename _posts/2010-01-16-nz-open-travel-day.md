title: NZ Open: Travel Day
---
<p>Thursday 14/10/2010 taxi picked me up and 4:40am (5 minutes early) to start my trip to Wanganui, New Zealand for the NZ Open. Despite the crap service I <a href="http://tim.26tp.com/post/2010/01/17/How-Virgin-BluePacific-Blue-pissed-me-off.aspx">wrote about</a> from Virgin/Pacific Blue the trip was uneventful.</p>
<p>Canberra to Sydney flight landed about 5 minutes early.</p>
<p>Had a wonderful breakfast at Danks Street Depot in the Airport. Ordered croissant ($6) with side of bacon ($5). OK, the croissant was not heated and a tad expensive but the bacon was massive. I&rsquo;d say at least 7 good sized rashes. Unbelievable for $5.00.</p>
<p>Sydney to Wellington flight landed about 15 minutes early. Immigration and customs was a breeze.</p>
<p>Took a while for the rental car company to pick us up but all went straight forward after that.</p>
<p>It was about 4:40 pm when we head for the &ldquo;2:15&rdquo; drive to Wanganui. That might be true if you don&rsquo;t hit peak hour traffic, stop for dinner or then get lost in Wanganui looking for the hotel. Robert assured us he saw the street we were on on Google earth and it was near the hotel. Well he might be number 10 on the croquet ranking list but he&rsquo;s not a good guide, we were way on the wrong side of town.</p>
<p>Anyway found the hotel at around 8:20pm. It basic but clean and will suit us well for the week.</p>
