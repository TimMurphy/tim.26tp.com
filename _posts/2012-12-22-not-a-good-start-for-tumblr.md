<p>So my first rant is at the host of this blog, tumblr.com.</p>

<ul><li>I cannot login with the iPhone app.</li>
<li>The mobile version of tumblr.com does not include a link to support or contact.</li>
<li>After visiting the &#8220;standard site&#8221; there is no obvious way to return to mobile site.</li>
</ul><p>Will someone at tumblr notice this post?</p>
