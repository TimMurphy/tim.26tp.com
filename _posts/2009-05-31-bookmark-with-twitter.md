title: Bookmark with Twitter
---
<p>In my job I often read "technical" blogs knowing I will need the refer back to them later. Of course I can bookmark them but then they get in the way of the everyday bookmarks and the page title is often not very useful. I think the answer is the tweet them instead.</p>
<h2>Create the Tweet</h2>
<p>The format of the tweet is: Description&nbsp;#bm url.</p>
<p>Description: is your description of the page you are bookmarking.</p>
<p>#bm: is the twitter tag to retrieve bookmarks by. You can use whatever ever tag you like just be consistent and short, you only have 140 characters in a tweet.</p>
<p>url: Is the address you are bookmarking. If you are using <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com">www.tweetdeck.com</a> then you are easily shorten the url.</p>
<p>Example: Create bookmarks with Twitter #bm <a href="http://bit.ly/2MOKO">http://bit.ly/2MOKO</a></p>
<h2>View Bookmarks</h2>
<p>To view you bookmarks simply do a twitter search:</p>
<p>http://search.twitter.com/search?&amp;tag=&lt;tag name&gt;&amp;from=&lt;your twitter name&gt;</p>
<p>tag name: is the tag you are using for bookmarks. Mine is bm. Do not include the # symbol here.</p>
<p>your twitter name: duh!</p>
<p>To view my bookmarks go to: <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?&amp;tag=bm&amp;from=timpmurphy">http://search.twitter.com/search?&amp;tag=bm&amp;from=timpmurphy</a></p>
<p>A quick google search does show tools to do similar for the moment at least I'm sticking to my idea. With a bit of creative thinking I'm sure you can come up with other ways to file your life using twitter.</p>
