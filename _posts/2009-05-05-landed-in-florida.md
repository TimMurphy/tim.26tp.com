title: Landed in Florida
---
<p>To follow are details of my flights to Florida. From the airport came straight to the courts. Have had a bit of a hit. Played well and then when I add on the fact I've not seen a bed from 40+ hours played great. Robert Fletcher is in fine form; he says today was the first day he felt good on the court since arriving. Leo McBride (Canada) peel rover straight for sextuple but strikers could not run hoop. The courts are good but now where near as flat as we thought they would be. Running at 12 seconds which is nice and comfortable, hopefully they'll get a bit quicker. Can't really comment on the new super hoops yet. The practice court has them set in old standard hoop holes so they are not as hard in the ground as others are suggesting they can be.</p>
<p>Eyes are popping out of my head but determined to stay up to 9pm local time to try and adjust the body clock quickly. Catch up again tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Canberra to Sydney</h2>
<p>AEST: Monday, 4th May at 8:10pm</p>
<p>Who would have thought the flight from Canberra to Sydney would be interesting enough for me to write about. Note I said interesting enough to write not necessarily interesting enough read.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s on the plane ready for scheduled takeoff at 4:15pm. That was until 2 unaccompanied kids (roughly 7 &amp; 10) start screaming blue murder, one in particular screaming quite loudly &ldquo;let me off the plane, I&rsquo;ve got to get off the plane&rdquo; and it worked. Nicky and I were sitting next to them in the airport, seems like they will be staying with grandma a little while longer.</p>
<p>Due into Sydney at 5pm, actually arrived at 5:40pm after offloading the kids. Got to International Airport walked straight up to the check in counter. About two hours to kill; smoking several cigarettes, a couple of phone calls, buy $US, buy cheap grog and cigarettes, wrote up this blog and its time to board.</p>
<h2>Sydney to LA</h2>
<p>AEST: Monday, 4th May at 11:35pm</p>
<p>The plane&rsquo;s computer is telling me the following: Sydney 11:35pm, LA&nbsp; 6:35am. Altitude 10,668 m, Distance from Sydney 3437km, Distance to LAX 4710km, Time to LAX 9h 39m, Outside Temperature -45C, Air Speed 912 kph.</p>
<p>Flying V Australia. It&rsquo;s a new plane and smells like a new car. Best guess its 2/3 full and I have a spare seat next to which makes a big difference. Asked for a exit row seat but that pleasure was going to cost $150. Glad I saved my money; there&rsquo;s actually a reasonable amount of leg room.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been about 10 years since I flew long haul. Individual screens with wide selection of movies, TV &amp; games make a big difference. Boredom factor not bad at the moment. &ldquo;Love the Beast&rdquo; by Eric Bana was a great yarn, currently watching Boston Legal one of favourite shows. And know I&rsquo;ve just learnt they can charge my computer for me when needed, what a ripper.</p>
<p>Now can someone explain this to me? We&rsquo;ve been travelling for nearly 4 hours to cover 3437km, average speed 860 kph. The current speed is 912 kph but lets us the current average of 860 kph with 4710 km which by my calculations is 5.16 hours to go. The plane&rsquo;s computer says 9h 39m to go, that&rsquo;s an average speed of 490 kph. Why such a big difference?</p>
<p>Time for a nap.</p>
<h2>Arrive in LA</h2>
<p>AEST: Tuesday, 5th May at 1:00pm, LA: Monday, 4th May at 8:00pm</p>
<p>Landed near scheduled time of 5pm local time, (Tuesday 10am AEST). Good flight. Probably got 4-5 hours sleep. Could have been more but wanted to start to get the body clock adjusted.</p>
<p>About 8 people in front of me at immigration but still took some time. They fingerprint and photograph everyone. That doesn&rsquo;t take too long it just seemed like there were a couple of people with &ldquo;issues&rdquo;. Bag was waiting for me and then straight through customs. This is going great&hellip;</p>
<p>Straight out of terminal group of official looking blokes as guides/helpers for LAX. They were very helpful but were actually working for a charity, what&rsquo;s $2 going to hurt me. Time for a smoke or three. The nicotine lozenge actually worked very well but there&rsquo;s nothing like the real thing.</p>
<p>Walk across 2 terminals (perfect directions for $2) to Delta. Self check in, I don&rsquo;t seem to have the write length booking number. No problems someone comes to help. We see my name on the screen but &ldquo;can not find electronic ticket&rdquo;, what the? At least 30 mins later with much tapping on the keyboard and 3 phone call I have my boarding passes. Time for some more smokes.</p>
<p>Damn hungry and no food outlets outside of the security area, oh well through I go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check point 1, checks I have a boarding pass and passport. Friendly.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Check point 2, does the same but this time get stamp on boarding pass, much closer look at passport photo and infrared light goes over the passport. Unfriendly.</li>
<li>Check point 3, Xray and metal detector machine. On top of the now Australian practice of computer and liquids have to be taken out of bag the US requires all shoes to be taken off. Just plain RUDE.</li>
<li>Check point 4, check the boarding pass and passport again. OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>This all took place around 7pm, 4 hours before my flight to Atlanta, I was going to go back out for a smoke after dinner but its truly not worth the hassle. Well that&rsquo;s the way I feel right now, might change in an hour or so.</p>
<p>Phone and computer on charger. Which there was a human charger. Off to find a red bull and fingers crossed for some free internet access.</p>
<p>PS. Just worked out its 14 hours different between Florida and Canberra. So lets see if this burnt out brain can get the math right. Left Canberra Monday, 16:15. Arrive Florida Tuesday, 10:15. Add 14 hours for get Wednesday 00:15 Canberra time. 32 hours of my live has just disappeared. It will be 43 hours since laying eyes on a bed. Please tell me I&rsquo;m wrong!</p>
<p>PPS. Had 2 large beers, am seriously tired. Nodding off in front of computer. Board in 10 mins, asleep in 20 I&rsquo;d guess. Bugger its only a 4h 20m flight.</p>
<h2>LA to Atlanta</h2>
<p>AEST: Tuesday, 5th May at 9:00pm. Atlanta: Tuesday, 5th May at 7:00am</p>
<p>29 hours since I left Canberra.</p>
<p>Heart flutter as I tried to board. The boarding pass scanner gave an error noise rather than the ok noise everyone before me got. Fortunately she went straight on computer and all ok within 15 seconds.</p>
<p>What is it about Americans and carry on luggage. They now have limits compared to last time I was in the US but the limits are huge.</p>
<p>Then we started taxiing out and stopped for 10 mins while they fixed the air conditioner. Got some poor sleep in.</p>
<p>Atlanta airport is huge. Was starting to make my way over to terminal T, made a wrong turn into a bar. Was about to walk straight out when I smelt smoke. Smoking in an airport, what a luxury.</p>
<h2>Atlanta to Florida</h2>
<p>Incident free. As you've now read picked up from airport and straight to courts. Out for another quick practice.</p>
