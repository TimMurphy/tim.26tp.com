<p>After returning from Florida I came down with a bad flu. It was at the height of the swine flu scare so we were quarantined and tested but negative. However the flu really hit be me for six. No work for 2 weeks. Since getting back to work I&rsquo;ve been working flat out. Had little time for croquet (nor the great desire) so practice has been light on. Practice has picked up a little in the last 2 weeks as the NSW Men&rsquo;s Open starts in 9 hours. Hope to provide you will daily posts. Time to sleep, catch up tomorrow.</p>
