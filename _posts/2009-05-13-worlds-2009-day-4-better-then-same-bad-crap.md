title: Worlds 2009, Day 4, Better then same bad crap
---
<p>First game of plate today against Tommy Harrington was better. Hit 4th turn, run h5 long and missed returned roquet. Next error was straight rover peel, strickers did not run hoop. Won +26.</p>
<p>Second game against Ed Cunningham was same lack of concentration crap. Had good chance to win game on 4b and going to peg but stuck in 4b from no where. Ed hit short one, finished his break from penult to peg, crossed wired me at 1, i missed he finished from 2b.</p>
<p>That knocks me out of the draw side of the plate. I start process side (2nd bite of cherry for non-croquet players) on Friday. Will have to hang around at HQ tomorrow waiting for adhoc z games.</p>
<p>Starting to look forward to going home.</p>
