title: How Virgin Blue/Pacific Blue pissed me off
---
<p>For some time now were possible I&rsquo;ve avoided flying Virgin Blue. For the trip to NZ 14 Jan 2010 I flew Virgin Blue/Pacific Blue as this was the flight the Fletcher&rsquo;s had already booked and I am sharing accommodation with them. I will now only fly Virgin Blue/Pacific Blue if I have no other reasonable choice.</p>
<p>This is how they pissed me off this time.</p>
<h2>Virgin Blue, 14/1/2010, Canberra to Sydney</h2>
<ul>
<li>They ask you to be checked in 60 minutes before departure. Advise you to allow time for queues and actually be checked in 60 minutes before departure. 60 minutes seems a long time to me.</li>
<li>On 14/1/2010 I had a 6:15 departure from Canberra to Sydney. Arrive at 4:55, we do not open for another 5 minutes Sir. 5:05 they open. So they expect us to arrive at the check in queue, assuming no long lines, between 62 and 70 minutes before departure.</li>
<li>The call to gate was 15 minutes prior to when we could actually start passing through the gate. I had stuff to do on the Internet. That 15 minutes would have been handy.</li>
<li>No sandwiches on Canberra to Sydney flight. Muffins or muesli bars.</li>
<li>27 passengers on a 737 but many people were seated next to strangers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pacific Blue, 14/10/2010, Sydney to Wellington</h2>
<ul>
<li>Departure lounge is dark and dingy.</li>
<li>Very few seats at our gate. None available.</li>
<li>Sat in seats at neighbouring gate. None of heard the call, just saw others boarding.</li>
<li>Did not have boarding pass at photo page of passport. Pacific Blue employee tells all passengers to have boarding pass at photo page of passport unlike the current passenger, me.</li>
<li>No hot food on flight.</li>
</ul>
<p>But all this is nothing compared to the way David was treated. David&rsquo;s leg was playing up so he was using an airport wheelchair. As soon as the Pacific Blue employee saw David, in a harsh tone tells David &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to come with me now so we can load you on the plane&rdquo;, this is 45 minutes before depature. David and Greg go to where instructed, employee has walked off. Greg leaves to find Robert who is getting breakfast and I stay with David. 5 minutes later employee turns up to</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee: &ldquo;right I have to load you on plane now&rdquo;</li>
<li>David: &ldquo;I have to wait for my sons, I have their passports and boarding passes&rdquo;</li>
<li>Employee: &ldquo;Leave them on the counter here, they&rsquo;ll get them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I take the passports and David is whisked away like a piece of luggage to be boarded on the plane.</p>
<p>Just a few nice words said in the right tone and all would be good.</p>
<p>Bye, bye Virgin/Pacific Blue. Hope never to fly with you again.</p>
