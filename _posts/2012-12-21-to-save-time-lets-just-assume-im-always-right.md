<p>Do I need to say any more by way of introduction?</p>

<p>OK, I&#8217;ll assume the answer is yes.</p>

<p>April 1st, 2012 was a life changing day, I had a stroke. Fortunately it was a mild stroke but to this very day I am tired all the time. Consequently, and understandably, my client has given me my marching orders and I will have zero clients mid February 2013. Given it is a struggle for me to work 10 hours a week it is going to hard to find new clients and work as a programmer. I&#8217;ve been self employed as a professional programmer for 23 years. Therefore, I&#8217;m trying to think outside the square for possible future income. Maybe I&#8217;ll create a high income blog, or maybe I&#8217;ll become a media slut, sorry personality. Many of the ideas I have involve a high level of communication skills. Time to improve the writing skills with this blog.</p>

<p>As the blog, and this post, title suggests I&#8217;m a reasonably opinionated person and I&#8217;m always right. Often <a href="https://twitter.com/timpmurphy">Twitter&#8217;s</a> 140 character limit just isn&#8217;t enough to let the world know what&#8217;s truly on my mind. I&#8217;ll be using this blog to bitch, sorry - point out, what someone or some organisation has done wrong and how they could have done better.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
