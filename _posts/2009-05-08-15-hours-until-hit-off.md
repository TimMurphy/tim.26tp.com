<p>Better practice today. Have had trouble with concentration but a chat with Liz today has really helped, thanks Liz.</p>
<p>Most of the Aussies headed up to PGA Resort for practice.&nbsp; They are much slower than here are NCC. Best guess 10 seconds. Flat as in court but a few of the boundaries roll away a bit. I expect several sextuples to be attempted and completed at this venue. The sad thing about practice there today is they only had Sunshiny balls and wide standard hoops. There will be Dawsons and Super Hoops there tomorrow when I play there. 6 of the 8 blocks have one day at PGA.</p>
<p>Details of the blocks have still not hit the net. I know what order I'm playing people but with 3.75 games being played on each court each day no idea when my byes will be. Hopefully we will find out more at the players meeting tonight.</p>
<p>Speaking of the players meeting reminds me that my Australian jacket arrived safe and sound. Only problem is its a bit snug around the back. Can't imagine why Mum and I double checked every measurement and went over not under. Oh well nothing I can do about it know.</p>
<p>Leaving now to get prettied up for the Opening Ceremony and players meeting. Hopefully a good nights sleep tonight and reports of winning. May not get internet access tomorrow night.</p>
