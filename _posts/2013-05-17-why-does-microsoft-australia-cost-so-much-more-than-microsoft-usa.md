## Visual Studio Professional 2012

- AU$724.00 [Microsoft Australia](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msaus/en_AU/pdp/productID.254677700)
- US$499.00  [Microsoft](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.254639600)

## Visual Studio Professional 2012 with MSDN

- AU$1.738 [Microsoft Australia](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msaus/en_AU/pdp/productID.254678000)
- US$1,199 [Microsoft](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.254640100)

Why does Microsoft Australia slug Australian developers 45% more for Visual Studio than American developers? 

- The AU$ has been parity or better with $US for months now so that can't be the issue.
- They are software downloads so shipping can't be the issue.
- Support costs? How often do developers call for support? Don't we pay per incident?
- Rip off?

I await reply from Microsoft Australia, ACCC &amp; Choice.
