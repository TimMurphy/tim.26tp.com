title: Worlds 2009, Day 6, Report 2
---
<p>Its only taken 6 days, and its all too late, but I finally proved I could play croquet today.</p>
<p>Lost the second round of Plate Process to Danny Hunneycutt. Start TPO but fell a bit short on ball at h5, hit it but squirted strikers out on stop shot, made hoop but could not hit. Danny hit with penult and ran to peg. I missed, Danny finished.</p>
<p>Played 3rd game of Z against Charlie Gillmartin USA. Just half an error not getting started after the leave. Opponent missed my next leave, finished with TP.</p>
<p>Played 4th game of Z against James Hopgood Scotland. Hit 3rd turn but backward take off to H2 turned with into leg. James made 1, I hit laid up, finished 9, finished TP.</p>
<p>I've won all 4 Z games. Don't know how many I need to have played but expect I will be in Z quarter finals tomorrow. Management&nbsp;pretty much has "who cares" attitude toward plate and Z so little information to know what's going on.</p>
<p>Robert Fletches AUS played brilliantly today beating James Death 3 - 1. Robert has two time world champion Reg Bamford (the only remaining seed) tomorrow. Reg's shooting is down on reputation. It should be a great match. Robert is the first Australian to make semis of the worlds. Go Robert.</p>
<p>Speaking of Reg I didn't meet him last worlds but have this one and he is a great guy. I've had a couple of drinks and chats with him. Then this afternoon seal the deal of being a great guy he gave Malcolm Fletcher aged 13 one of his pidcock mallets (A$700-800). When asked Malcolm confirmed he will be taking it to bed with him tonight :-).</p>
