title: LAX is a shithole
---
<p>I've known for a long time that LAX is a shithole of an airport but the terminal I'm in for V Australia must be the shithole of all shitholes. Words can't describe it and/or I'm too tired to do so. The very few good places to plug in the PC are taken so I'm at a&nbsp; "Samsung" charging centre. All plugs are taken but fortunately one was taken by and Aussie and she happily let me use my double adapter so we are both charging. The table around the power points is tiny, can't even fit the entire PC on it and its just got 2 stools around it. So that's enough from me for now. I'll leave the PC plugged in and sit in a more comfortable chair while it charges.</p>
