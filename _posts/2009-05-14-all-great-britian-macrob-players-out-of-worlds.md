title: All Great Britian MacRob players out of Worlds
---
<p>I think this news is worthy of a second blog today. All 6 current GB MacRob were knocked out today or earlier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jonathan Kirby did not qualify.</li>
<li>Keith Aiton out in Round of 32.</li>
<li>Mark Avery out in Round of 32.</li>
<li>Robert Fulford out in Round of 16.</li>
<li>Chris Clarke out in Round of 16.</li>
<li>David Maugham out in Round of 16.</li>
</ol>
<p>I've just realised that no current MacRob are still in the knockout draw.</p>
