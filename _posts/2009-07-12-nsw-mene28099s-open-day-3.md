<p>Good day today.</p>
<p>The pressure was on in the first game. I had to beat Trevor to make the top super block. Having missed my duffers tice and then h2 to c4 shot I was staring down the barrel of a &ndash;26tp loss. Sadly for Trevor with 2 peels done he failed to get in front of 4b. I hit the 3 yarder, and made 9. Trev missed but I could not start. Trev hit 20 yard partner ball but then missed 3 yarder on me. I did 12 then 5.</p>
<p>Pete did virtually the exact same thing as Trev. Though this time I made 9 with good leave and started ontime triple only to poorly rush to behind 6 then&nbsp; could not get in front of hoop with peelee in the way. Pete hit made 4b and penult, I missed 14 yarder, Pete made rover, I missed 27 yarder, Pete finished.</p>
<p>Beat John Levick +18tp.</p>
<p>Nick and I pegged down with me h1 &amp; 1, Nick h1 &amp; 5.</p>
<p>My chances of making the final evaporated after losing to Pete but beating Alan and Nick is important.</p>
