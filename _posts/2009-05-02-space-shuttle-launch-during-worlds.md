title: Space Shuttle launch during Worlds
---
<p>Just found out that on Monday May 11 (Day 3 of Worlds) that NASA will be <a title="Space Shuttle Missions" href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html">launching a space shuttle</a> at 2:01 pm. The launch is from <a title="Map from Cape Canaveral to West Palm Beach" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=National+Croquet+Center,+West+Palm+Beach+%4026.665367,-80.078906&amp;geocode=&amp;dirflg=&amp;daddr=Cape+Canaveral,+FL&amp;f=d&amp;sll=26.750516,-80.108185&amp;sspn=0.903782,0.979156&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=27.722436,-80.496826&amp;spn=3.583242,3.916626&amp;t=h&amp;z=8">Cape Canaveral</a> about 200 miles north of West Palm Beach. We will be lucky enough to see it fly over the croquet courts?</p>
<p>Shame the launch isn't a day later. Tuesday is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">playoff</span> block tiebreak day, so a rest day for most players. If not playing in the playoff it would be worth the trip.</p>
