title: NSW Menâ€™s Open Day 1 & 2
---
<p>Day 1. Roqueting was poor, croquet shots were average but 3 wins from 3. 2TPs and in the other game completed 3 peels, rover hoop in the way to go for peg out and bombard failed. Only conceded 1 hoop and 2 errors.</p>
<p>Day 2. Awful. Lost all 3 games. Had game on mallet in first game but failed hoop 2. Games two and three lost to TPs but I did make errors to let opponents in.</p>
<p>I have to beat Trevor tomorrow to make the top super block.</p>
