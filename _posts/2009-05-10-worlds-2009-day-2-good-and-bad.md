title: Worlds 2009, Day 2, Good and Bad
---
<p>First game was against Ed Ducworth. He beat Clarke and Death day 1 so was in fine touch. For the first half of the game the croquet gods were not on my side. After 3.5 hours I pegged out the front ball 15 seconds before time, second ball 5 seconds after time. It was a real battle and very pleased with myself to hang in there.</p>
<p>Second game against Johnny Osborn. He played great to beat be 26-12. I made 2 errors and 3 poor roquet attempts.</p>
<p>Third game against Alan Morris. Played great with 2 peels of triple completed. Won 26-6.</p>
<p>So I'm 3 wins from 6 games. Tomorrow I have Ron Lloyd, Chris Clarke &amp; James Death. Unfortunately the website so I don't really know how many wins are needed to qualify but best guess is 5 wins will get into tie break play off, 6 straight through. Fingers crossed.</p>
