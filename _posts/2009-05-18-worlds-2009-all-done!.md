<p>Sorry for the delay on my last days play but it didn't end until 10 mins before the official dinner.</p>
<p>At the start of the day the manager simply allowed anyone who wanted to play the in Z knockout to enter and it was a random draw. 3 of the top 4 players drew onto the same side of the draw; myself, Stephen Forster &amp; Ian Lines. Brian Cumming was on the otherside with a relatively easy draw.</p>
<p>My first game was against Andrew Winn, England. It was a battle with my roquet not that great. In the end I hit a cross court roquet, pegged Andrew out for 4b &amp; box vs 2b &amp; peg. I played the end game well to win +3 with 8 minutes to spare.</p>
<p>Second game was against Stephen Forster, Victoria Australia. Played very well in this game except for sticking in 2b and 1b. Won the game +7.</p>
<p>Third game against Ian Lines, England. I made 4th turn 9 and Ian hit in. He made a few mistakes but I could not hit, each shot not shorter than 12 yards or if I did hit in it was with 4b ball and despite good long leaves Ian hit. Finally I got back when Ian was 4b &amp; 4b. Only got to peel 4b staight with good leave but of course Ian hit. I got back in but failed penult, Ian hit and finished with leave, I missed and lost the game. Ian said the better player did not win which was nice (and correct). He said the same thing about his final but he won that too.</p>
<p>Robert Fletcher played great in the semi against Reg but lost in 4. Reg went on to win the Final quite easily against Ben Rothman 3-0.</p>
<p>It was a great tournament. It was a great thrill to be there to see how well the Fletcher boys did especially Robert.</p>
<p>I'm currently in Atlanta airport, having a smoke. Will make another post about what I learnt when in LA. Home in 30 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
