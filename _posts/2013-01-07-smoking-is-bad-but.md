<p>I have no doubt smoking is bad for you and those who inhale your second hand smoke but Australia has gone crazy on the issue.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, carparks do not allow smoking, why? Who or want is it going to harm. What about the car exhaust fumes? Are they going to be banned? When I was a smoker and Nicky was with me the first thing after getting out of the car or shops I wanted and had a cigarette, fuck the signs. Where did they want me to have my cigarette?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t feel strongly either why about plain packaging. I have my doubts on its effectiveness but I don&#8217;t care. However last week we saw the most ridiculous thing at <a href="http://www.hyperdome.com.au/home/">Tuggeranong Hyperdome</a>. On one wall of the smoke shop were the cigarettes behind doors. On the other wall&#8230; bongs galore. So its OK to display equipment to smoke illegal drugs but its not OK to display legal drugs. Am I the only one that thinks this is stupid?</p>

<p>Will we ever see the day when politicians have the guts make tobacco illegal? I guess not but they should. I said this before I gave up the smokes, boy do I wish it happened years ago.</p>
