title: Fletcher * 3 in the Worlds
---
<p>All 3 Fletcher boys are in the Worlds! Robert had already been selected, Greg won 12 from 14 in the qualifier. Malcolm came 9th which initially meant he missed out but Nelson Morrow in 6th declined his position due to work commitments. Then Rhys Tomas and Tony Hall each declined their spots due to refereeing commitments. Therefore Malcolm has earned the 6th qualifying spot. Still be confirmed but its believed at 14 that Malcolm is the youngest player in the Worlds all time. We are all so excited for them both. Go Fletcher!</p>
