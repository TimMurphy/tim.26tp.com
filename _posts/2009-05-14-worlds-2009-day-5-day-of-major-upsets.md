title: Worlds 2009, Day 5, Day of MAJOR upsets
---
<p>No major upsets caused by me. Just 2 games. 1 z game which I won, 2 from 2 in that event but don't know what the minimum games required is to make the finals on Saturday. In the plate I won my first round to process side (second chance) against AJ Haken (Reid). Ugly game but won by 2.</p>
<p>Now onto the major upsets.</p>
<p>Robert Fletcher, Aus, 15 years old, World #13 beat David (The Beast) Maugham World #10 in 5 games. Very exciting match. Robert won the first 2. In the 5th he missed the peg out to complete the triple but peg out the other ball. Both players played the 2 vs 1 well until The Beast stuck in hoop 6 and Robert hit the 14 yarder to win the game.</p>
<p>Ben Rotham, USA, World #18 beat Robert Fulford World #2 several times winner of this event 3 - 0.</p>
<p>James Death, UK, World #27 beat Chris Clarke, UK, World #1, defending champion in 4 games.</p>
