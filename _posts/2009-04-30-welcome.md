<p>Welcome. What a boring first title!</p>
<p>Finally in the 21st century and got myself a blog. Why have I started it now when I've far too many things do before I head to Florida? Because I am heading to Florida to play in the World Championships, just&nbsp;3 more sleeps. I figured a blog and <a title="Tim on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/timpmurphy">twitter</a> would be the best way for me to provide updates while I'm away. Having said that not sure how much internet access I'll have. We will have access at the <a title="National Croquet Center" href="http://www.croquetnational.com/">National Croquet Center</a> and maybe at the <a title="PGA National Club" href="http://www.pgaresort.com/">PGA National Club</a>&nbsp;but probably not where we are staying. I'll do my best to write a blog each day, even if its just the results for the day (hopefully with me winning my fair share).</p>
<p>You might like to save one or more of the following links to your favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Blog. Includes <a href="http://twitter.com/timpmurphy">twitter</a> updates on the right hand side.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>What's an RSS feed?</strong></p>
<p>If your not already using RSS then don't worry about it, just keep going back to my blog's home page.</p>
<p>But if you are interested. <em>"RSS solves a problem for people who regularly use the web. It allows you to <strong>easily stay informed</strong> by retrieving the latest content from the sites you are interested in. You <strong>save time</strong> by not needing to visit each site individually. You <strong>ensure your privacy</strong>, by not needing to join each site's email newsletter."</em> <a title="What is RSS" href="http://www.whatisrss.com/">WhatIsRSS.com</a>.</p>
<p>OK, on with some real work.</p>
<p>PS. Like the domain name?</p>
