title: Super Hoops.

<p>The Americans specifically created a new set of hoops for the World Championships; they dubbed them "super hoops". I was literally about to start writing this blog when Stephen Forster placed the balls in hoop 5 court 10.</p>

<p>The hoops must be respected. They can be run softly, even from a fair angle. Try to hit the ball hard through the hoop; forget it. 6 ft out at 2b to bash through to the boundary; bad idea. Try a jump shot for an angly hoop; good luck. The hoops will present the challenge that deserves a World Championship.</p>
<p>My practice today was so so but really enjoying myself. All the Aussies have arrived. Lets hope we all get over the jet lag soon.</p>
