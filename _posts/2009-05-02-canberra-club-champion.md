<p>Pleased to report I won the club championships for the second year running. Beat Alan Honey 26-14, 26tp-4. Far to many mistakes in the first game but the second was better with just one mistake not running 2b cleanly. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Game reports as I can best remember to follow</span>. Well I just learnt I can't remember games well enough after 24 hours to write a&nbsp;full report. Lesson learnt for Worlds. Highlights and lowlights to follow.</p>
<p>Game 1.&nbsp;Tim made H1 with each ball but stuffed up each time before H2. Did all 3 peels before 2b to go on and fail 4b. 5 more turns to finish.</p>
<p>Game 2. 7th turn 8, could not hit after 2b. 9th turn made 3b with great leave. 10th turn Alan hits and fails H5. Tim finishes with TP.</p>
