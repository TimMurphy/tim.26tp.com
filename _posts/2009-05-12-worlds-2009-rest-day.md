title: Worlds 2009, Rest Day
---
<p>Great rest day for me; much sleep. Plate tomorrow but still to find out when/where/who to play. Communication for the event has been poor.</p>
<p>5 Aussies have qualified. Results are now being posted at <a href="http://2009worldchampionship.com/">http://2009worldchampionship.com/</a>&nbsp;although not as frequently as everyone would like.</p>
